  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>🧠 Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm Wyatt—builder, breaker, automator. I spend most of my time navigating the weird intersection of IT ops, app dev, and creative problem-solving. This site? It started as a Flask sandbox, but it's grown into a place where I tinker, test ideas, and experiment with making tech that actually *feels good* to use.</p>
    <p>I like figuring things out the hard way, not because it’s efficient—but because it teaches me something real. That’s the core of this whole setup. Controlled chaos, but it works.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>🛠️ Projects I’m Working On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Play Maker</strong>: a multi-sport strategy platform where coaches can draw plays, simulate player motion, and eventually use AI to predict outcomes. It’s like if Madden and Google Docs had a baby… but it’s mine.</li>
      <li><strong>Canvas Engine</strong>: a pure JS browser gamepad I’m building from scratch—think movement, collision, event triggers. No libraries. No fluff. Just canvas and code.</li>
      <li><strong>Workflow Automation</strong>: building out complex forms + approval systems using Flask, SQL, and Laserfiche—cutting down wasted time in tribal government systems and replacing it with real, trackable logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Formbot</strong>: a hardware/software sidekick with a separate “brain” (AI logic) and “body” (motors, sensors, voice). It listens, thinks, responds—and maybe waters your plants if I finish it.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>🎧 My Vibe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🕹 Gamer since dial-up. I like games that make you think: <em>Outer Wilds</em>, <em>Factorio</em>, <em>Into the Breach</em>, anything with systems and layers.</li>
      <li>🎶 Constant lo-fi beats or synthwave in the background—keeps the mind sharp and the soul vibing.</li>
      <li>📚 Always learning. If I’m not writing code, I’m usually reverse-engineering someone else’s—or questioning the entire stack.</li>
      <li>🧠 High-functioning chaos: I move fast, break stuff, but always know how to put it back together cleaner than before.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="about-card">
    <h2>🌟 Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🔧 Built a custom approval voting system with parallel routing and SQL persistence that functions inside a legacy document platform—and it works like magic.</li>
      <li>🤝 Developed strong working relationships with external vendors by just being real—technical rapport over fake professionalism, every time.</li>
      <li>🌀 Learned to turn burnout into productivity by building tools that work how I *wish* things worked. My codebase is sometimes therapy.</li>
      <li>🚀 Everything I build is with future-me in mind: faster, smoother, more expressive—and if someone else benefits, that’s the bonus.</li>
    </ul>
